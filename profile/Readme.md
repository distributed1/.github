# Welcome to distributed1

Distributed1 is a personal project to play with different distributed system design patterns and implementations.  
These implementations will not pretend to be a reference for production-ready examples. Instead, they can be used to enable conversations and learning workshops.

Our labs contain system designs and their implementations to solve technical and business challenges for fictional companies' scenarios. The challenges can be related to one or many business use cases.    

The name convention for the labs is:

```
LAB000-[company]-[main challenge (optional)]
```
